This folder is for TicTacToe but made from Python turtle

In this folder there is a folder and a file.

Both of them was compiled from PyInstaller.

The file is a macOS application, so for Mac users run the file and TicTacToe made from Python turtle will launch as a regular application.

The folder contains the TicTacToe python turtle executable file. The executable file is for Windows users. Double click on the .exe file and it will launch TicTacToe.

MAKE SURE TO LEAVE THE .EXE FILE IN ITS FOLDER. Otherwise the .exe file will not work and it will come up with an error.


--- TicTacToe is cross platform and will work for LAN multiplayer for Windows and macOS users
